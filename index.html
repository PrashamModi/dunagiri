        <b>Dunagiri Retreat</b> offers freedom from the madness and pressures
        of modern life. We offer a space where reflection and refreshment of
        the soul take place as people leave their busy routines behind. Meant
        for nature lovers and spiritual seekers who value peace, and
        appreciate the natural grandeur of their surroundings, your stay with
        us will leave you refreshed, renewed, and uplifted. Inspired by the
        idea that it’s love and not money that makes the world go around,
        Piyush Kumar founded <b>Dunagiri Retreat</b> in 2005 after leaving a
        lucrative career at the World Bank. He wanted to create a different
        kind of resort—one that benefits the ecology and the local population
        as much as it does the visitor. As a result,
        <b>Dunagiri Retreat</b> is entirely served by the villagers of this
        area; everyone working here is a farmer and a resident of the three
        villages that surround us. And together—visitor and villager alike—we
        attempt to realize the four guiding principles that form the heart of
        <b>Dunagiri Retreat</b>: To generate sustainable livelihoods with
        dignity for residents; To supplement educational resources of the
        area; To provide primary and preventive healthcare to residents and;
        To examine how - from stones to insects to plants, humans, and birds –
        how can we all joyously coexist together as we believe it is possible.
        During your stay here, we pray you will discover all of the reasons
        that make Dunagiri Retreat such a special place—from its ancient and
        sacred history to its pristine natural beauty, and the positive
        influence of your visit on the local population. You will arrive as a
        guest, but leave as family having discovered “the road less traveled,"
        as Robert Frost expressed, has made all the difference.

        <h1>HISTORY,LEGENDS & MYTHS</h1>
        <p>Most Temples and holy places accrue higher respect the older they are. For instance the 3000 year old temple
          of Kanyakumari may be deemed more potent than a 300 year old temple. At Dunagiri, it is not in years,
          centuries nor even millennia that the antiquity is calculated in, but rather in terms of Yugas! A place where
          mysticism abounds, Dunagiri vibrates with numerous stories, sacred legends and myths.

          <br>
          <br>

          <b>King Bharat:</b> King Bharat, son of king Dushyanta and celestial Shakuntala, after whom India is named
          “Bharatvarsh”, was born at Sukhadevi, a brief walk from Dunagiri Retreat.


          <br>
          <br>
          <b>Lord Hanuman and the Sanjeevani herb:</b> Dunagiri is the home of mythical herb 'Sanjeevani' with life
          giving
          powers. In the epic Ramayana, Lord Hanumana comes to Dunagiri to fetch this herb to revive Lord Rama's brother
          Lakshmana who lay unconscious in the battlefield.


          <br><br>
          <b>Pandavas: </b>a short distance from Dunagiri Retreat is the picturesque spot of Pandavkholi, where the five
          Pandava brothers of the epic Mahabharata spent a portion of their anonymous exile . Now an ashram of himalayan
          yogis.


          <br><br>
          <b>Rishis and Yogis:</b> Just like grass and shrubs growing near a sandalwood tree imbibe some of the
          fragrance of
          sandal, similarly every part of the mountains around Dunagiri Retreat, every leaf and every blade of grass is
          imbued with the spiritual vibrations of the numerous realized souls who have meditated here. Sage Bharatmuni
          renounced worldly life and came to the hills of Dunagiri to meditate in solitude, as did Dronacharya, Rishi
          Garga and Sukhdeva Muni, son of Rishi Ved Vyasa. Shwetashwet Upanishad was composed at Dunagiri.

          <br><br>
          <b>Mahavatar Babaji:</b> Dunagiri is also known as the birthplace of modern day Kriya Yoga. It is at Dunagiri
          in 1861
          that the divine current of Kriya Yoga was revealed by Mahavatar Babaji to Shyamacharan Lahiri. As mentioned by
          Swami Yogananda in 'An Autobiography of Yogi', the area of Dunagiri is still blessed by the living presence of
          Babaji, the secluded master who has retained his physical form for centuries, perhaps for millenniums.
